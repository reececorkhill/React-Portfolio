This is my React portfolio where you can learn more about me, view my projects and resume and get in touch with me.

## Description
My new an updated Portfolio is built using React.js âš›

The motivation behind this project was to update my current portfolio to fall in line with more modern web technologies, instead of using barebones HTML, CSS and Bootstrap. By using a a JavaScript library such as React, I've been able to reduce the amount of single file code for the project whilst integrating functionality at the same time, this can be seen in action when you click the Projects link in the Navigation Bar - simple and subtle but it does alot under the hood.

The main aim behind rebuilding my portfolio using React was to develop my skills further and at the same time, improve my online presence at the same time. This project was a great learning experience and came with some challenges such as, taking data from a JSON file and mapping this data to a component's structure and passing props accordingly where needed. 

By solving these, at what seemed like big issues at the time but turned out to be small problems looking back, I've been able to create a fully responsive and lightweight web application that dynamically and conditionally renders pages based on user interaction.

## Features
- **Fully-Responsive:** This React project is fully responsive ðŸ‘€
- **Dynamic and Fast:** The Project is not only dynamic but fast at rendering, thanks to Vite + React âš¡
- **Sleek and Modern:** Thanks to a combination of packages, the project looks sleek and modern without sacrificing performance ðŸ‘“
